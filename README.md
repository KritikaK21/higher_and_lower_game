# higher_and_lower_game
A straightforward guessing game called "Higher or Lower" is implemented in this Python project. 
The objective of the game is for the player to predict whether the following number will be higher or lower after a random number between 1 and 100 is generated.  
A scoring system allows players to monitor their progress and provide them with real-time feedback on their estimates. 
Players of various skill levels can have a fun and interesting time with the game.
Key features:
creation of random numbers within a predetermined range.
interface that is easy to use for feedback and input.
a system of scoring to monitor player performance.
The ability to play the game more than once.
Usage: 
Make a local copy of the repository.
Open higher_or_lower.py in Python and run it.
Play the game by adhering to the on-screen directions.
Determine if the number after this one will be more (h) or lower (l) than the one before it.
See how many accurate predictions you can make and have fun with the challenge!
Leant valuable skills and concepts like:
Programming Fundamentals: Utilizing basic programming ideas like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions is necessary to construct the game.
Random Number Generation: The random module in Python is used to create random numbers within a certain range.
Handling User Input: Applying validation to user input to make sure it is of the right data type and falls within the anticipated range.
Conditional Statements: Employing if-else statements, ascertain if the user's prediction is higher or lower by comparing it to the randomly generated number.
Scoring system: Place a scoring system, such as counting the number of accurate guesses, to monitor the player's performance.
Game Logic: Creating the logic for the game, which includes keeping track of the current number, comparing guesses, giving the player feedback, and terminating the game as needed.
Loops and iteration: Using loops to enable the player to play several game rounds and provide the option to retry the game after each round is known as looping and iteration.
Error Handling: Preventing program crashes and unpredictable behavior by elegantly handling possible errors or incorrect inputs.
All things considered, making a Higher or Lower game in Python is a great method to hone your programming abilities while producing a fun and engaging project.
